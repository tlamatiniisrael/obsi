==Being a creator, I love the process of consuming content as much as I enjoy creating it. I often tell my friends (mostly unprompted) that if you want to be a great creator, you should consume more content.==

Needless to say, I consume a great deal of content daily, and as a naturally curious person, I continually explore and learn about a wide range of topics.

But the problem is that not everything I consume stays in my head. As you all know, our brains are for having ideas, not holding them.

While I have been using a few apps over the years to store all my ideas and information, the recent influx of AI-based note-taking and personal knowledge management apps has made me wonder whether I am managing my notes and PKM system most efficiently.

This led me to explore and discover many interesting apps that uniquely facilitate the concept of building a second brain by consolidating all the content you consume in your digital life.

In this post, I will introduce you to seven Mac apps that I have selected as the most valuable and feature-rich, allowing you to build a second brain using your Mac, all with reasonable subscription costs.

_Let’s get into it._

### Craft

Craft has been my go-to PKM app for the past few years. While I initially just started using it to take random notes, over the years, both the app and my note-taking needs have evolved, and I now use it to manage a significant portion of my second brain.

Craft has one of the cleanest and most aesthetically pleasing designs of any notes app I have used, and it is also structured in a way that allows you to keep your content organized and quickly access and manage all of your notes and folders with minimal effort.

The app allows you to create multiple workspaces to manage various aspects of your life, such as work, personal projects, and side hustles. You can also further organize each workspace with folders and subpages, and even star and pin essential documents for easy access.

I also love that you can customize each page with its own template, background, and font options, adding a bit of flair to different types of content.

Craft has integrated AI functionalities into the app without them being too in your face, and they mostly stay out of the way unless you explicitly want to use them to help you write or manage your content.

I use Craft as a Second Brain for managing my book journals and noting down things I found interesting from the content I consume. I also use it to draft my blog posts and [Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-useful-tech-podcast/id1823509138) scripts, and even to store and brainstorm content ideas.

I have a separate workspace for my work-related documents, where I take calendar-synced meeting notes and manage daily to-do list items, and maintain SOP documents and presentation drafts.

If you want a clean-looking app with a great user experience, intuitive features, customizability options, and AI features that enhance your experience rather than being there just to tick a box, Craft is a great app to build your second brain on your Mac.

### Fabric

Fabric is an app I recently discovered while searching for an app that would help me organize the variety of notes I add throughout the day with minimal effort.

While, at first impression, the app did not feel as polished as well-established apps like Craft or Notion, I quickly familiarized myself with the user interface, and I have come to like the Kanban view that lets you organize different types of notes, files, and images by simply dragging and dropping them into various categories.

Unlike Craft or other note-taking apps, which are text-first, Fabric handles all types of files you throw at it with ease. It also provides a rich preview of images and PDFs added to the app, as well as the transcript of YouTube videos.

Fabric has a tight AI integration across the app, and by default, shows you a simple AI summary of any type of content you preview within the app. The AI integration also allows you to chat with a selected item and ask any questions, and even saves the AI response as a new note, linking it to the original content.

You can upload or submit any content to a workplace in Fabric, including voice notes, and let the app automatically categorise it into a relevant folder or a tag.

My favorite AI feature in Fabric is its powerful natural language and visual search functionality, which lets you find anything in your workspace, including content embedded within images and files. You can even upload an image to find similar pictures stored across your workspace, or even search for images based on the colours in them.

The app is relatively new, but it is surprisingly stable for a beta, and the developers promise to add more features, such as task management and reminders, in future updates.

If you want an AI-powered PKM app that can act as your second brain and handle anything you throw at it, automatically organize your content, and let you find anything with ease, then Fabric ticks all your boxes.

### Saner AI

Saner AI is marketed as an AI Personal assistant app for people with ADHD. While having ADHD is not a requirement to use the app, enabling the ADHD mode certainly helps anyone who has a chaotic list of tasks and notes to manage.

The app features a familiar interface and integrates AI at every step, from answering questions about your tasks and notes to providing AI summaries and suggested actions based on your content.

What I find most useful is that, instead of relying on your entire knowledge base of content for context, you can let the AI select context only from specific notes within your library. It also features a chat interface, allowing you to continue any conversations, similar to interacting with ChatGPT.

Another cool feature in Saner AI that not many other second brain apps have is that it automatically groups similar notes and makes them accessible from any notes file.

If you have already used popular note-taking apps like Notion or Evernote, you will feel at home using Saner AI. It has all the features you would expect from a second brain app, including organizational options, task management, AI summaries, and more.

However, the app is still relatively new, and some people might feel it is limiting, especially those who have used feature-rich apps like Notion in the past. But I think that’s by design, and if you want a simple app that focuses on the value you get out of it rather than adding all the bells and whistles, it's worth giving Saner AI a try.

### Kortex

I first discovered Kortex through a YouTube video, and it looked promising, so I checked out their website to download the app and try it for myself. I must say I was very impressed by the way the app and the onboarding process were designed.

Unlike most note taking apps where you start with a blank slate, which often makes it feel overwhelming, Kortex takes a hand holding approach and provides you with a list of templates for use cases like planning a life reset, general note taking, and even a space where you can outline ideas for your blog, newsletter, or YouTube channel.

My favorite feature is the ability to open each note as a separate pane, enabling you to work efficiently across multiple notes. The app is also designed to be keyboard-first, allowing you to use shortcuts for nearly everything, which is a nice touch when you are in the flow of building your second brain and don’t want to keep switching between your mouse and keyboard.

One challenge people may face when building a second brain is that they often struggle to structure their thoughts or ideas effectively. Kortex helps with this by providing you with detailed prompts and instructions for everyday use cases. You can also invoke a floating chat window with Option + C to capture any random thought or idea into Kortex.

If you are looking for a second brain app that does all of the heavy lifting for you while you focus on dumping the thoughts from your brain and things from the internet, Kortex might just be the app for you.

### Tana

At first glance, Tana resembles most other second brain apps I've reviewed for this blog post. However, it stands out with one unique feature called Supertags, which gives it a significant edge over similar apps.

Whenever you are building a personal knowledge management system, you are typically dealing with a large volume of disparate content. If the app you are using isn't intuitive enough, you'll spend a lot of time organizing instead of using the data meaningfully.

In Tana’s case, instead of requiring you to create multiple files or folders with endless customization options, the app asks you to use Supertags. This approach eliminates the need to make lists, tables, link to notes, or add images. Based on the name you give to it, the corresponding page will automatically be customized to match the context.

For example, one of my main second brain use cases is to keep track of all the books I read, highlight interesting ideas, give them ratings and reviews, and link to other books by the same author. In other apps, such as Notion, you must manually create a table, add and customize separate columns for the desired details to accommodate the specific data you will be adding.

However, in Tana, you can add a Supertag called #book next to the name of a book, and the app will make the name clickable to open a new page, which will have all the suggested fields in a table view based on the context and the name of the Supertag. In this case, it will create fields for author name, Genre, Book image, etc.

The Supertags work for other types of content too, like creating Kanban boards, Meeting summary pages, and even task management systems with task statuses, deadlines, priorities, etc. All you have to do is type out the raw content, use a relevant Supertag, and let the app take care of the rest.

Tana also has a bunch of other cool features like a knowledge graph, similar to the one in Obsidian, a daily notes template, and, of course, in 2025, you also get an AI copilot that can be used to organize, rewrite, and add content on your behalf to your second brain.

### Taskade

Taskade is probably the most powerful app in this list to be used as your Second Brain. While Taskade started as a PKM app to help you organize and manage your notes and tasks, it has recently evolved into an AI agent-first tool that lets you configure and use different types of AI agents.

You can use these AI agents to automate repetitive and complex tasks in your workflow, so you can spend more time consuming content and coming up with new ideas instead of spending countless hours neatly arranging all your notes.

Let’s say you attend an average of 4–5 meetings in a day. At the end of every meeting, you take the meeting Transcript and then ask an AI to summarize it, extract the action items from it, and then add these as tasks in your to-do list folder, and add priority and deadlines to it.

This will eat up at least 2 hours of your time every day. But with Tana, you can set up an Agent that will automatically do all of this once you provide the transcript and configure it with information on what to do and where to add stuff.

Taskade also offers built-in web scraping capabilities as part of the AI agent automation. This means you can extract information from blogs, newsletters, or social media posts without manually typing it out or copying from the site. You can also configure it to format the content in the way you want and even add it to your preferred folder.

If you are a busy person or handle a lot of information regularly, the AI agent and AI automation workflows in Taskade will elevate your second brain capabilities to the next level.

### Capacities

While Capacities looks like a simple app at first glance, the reason it made its way into this post is because of the way it forms connections between everything you throw at the app and shows all the content you added to the app in a neatly organized timeline view. This feature is not available in many other apps in this list, at least not in an intuitive out-of-the-box way.

Capacities organizes your content into ‘Objects,’ essentially treating everything you add—photos, notes, projects, tasks, ideas, thoughts, pages, etc. —as separate objects. This means that instead of creating separate files or folders whenever you want to organize stuff, you add it to its relevant Object type, and the app will let you form a link between relevant objects and even show them in a knowledge graph view.

For example, let’s say you are reading a book. You can add all the details about the book, when you started reading it, author details, your rating, etc, into a book object, and then any ideas you got from the book can be added to the idea object, you can then link this idea object to the book object, and even link more objects to it, like a video review of the book, or a friend you want to talk to the book about, etc.

This way, instead of creating a new file or a note every time you want to create something new in your second brain, you simply add it to a relevant predefined Object and let the app do its magic. You can also create your own Object types, for example, a task object, where you can add all your to-do list items and then link them to their corresponding projects in a project object.

If you want to do minimal work in organizing your notes and tasks, but still want a granular level of control in how they are organized and linked each other, you would definitiely enjoy using Capacities, along with its knowledge graph feature and the timeline view.
