Every day, we perform countless tasks on our Macs without even thinking. These small actions — renaming files, opening the same set of apps, and sorting downloads—all create _workflow friction_.

Ever notice how a 30-second task can derail your concentration on a project?

You don’t need to be an expert or know any coding — **all it takes to** **learn automation** is to use the tools already available on macOS.

## The Easiest Way to Get Started

One of the most beginner-friendly automation tools is **Apple’s Shortcuts app**, which is installed on every Mac by default.

==The concept of the app is simple — chain actions together and activate them from one place. It uses a simple drag-and-drop interface, like LEGO blocks.==

The shortcuts themselves could be simple or complex.

**Some chains include launching apps together, batch-renaming files, setting your focus modes, converting text to audio and other simple actions.**

But Shortcuts can do _way_ more. Let's start with the simple things.

## Learning Shortcuts

**_Step 1:_** Open Spotlight _(Command + Space)_ and type in “Shortcuts,” then hit return.

**_Step 2:_** Tap on the small plus icon located near the search bar in the top right corner.

**You just created a blank shortcut.**

Below is an example of a shortcut, but we are going to create a simple one from scratch. For this section, notice that on the right side there are a bunch of actions — the things that we want to automate.

We drag them to the left to create LEGO building blocks for actions we want to automate together.

**We select an action and set parameters to create a chain.**

### Let’s Try to Make One!

My goal is to make a simple chain to open Spotify and resize it to fit the screen.

Search for the “Open App” action in the search bar, then drag it into the left panel. Select the app you want to open from the dropdown menu.

Then, to resize the application, you can use the “Resize Window” action and drag it on the bottom of “Open Spotify.”

Notice how there is a small white line in the center. This means that the two actions are chained together.

That's it! Now all we have to do is rename the shortcut to something familiar. In this case I like the name “Open Spotify.”

**We can also customize the icon.** Since Spotify is a music app and has a green logo, I made my shortcut icon the same.

Once we combine this with many apps and set the appropriate resize actions, here is how beautiful and satisfying it can look:

### Tip of the Iceberg

Opening and resizing apps is as simple as it gets.

This app has integration with third-party software, the ability to manipulate calendars and to-do lists, make calls with links, run shell commands, and even chain other shortcuts on top of one another.

**The possibilities are hypothetically endless.**

## Using Shortcuts Efficiently.

In order to use these shortcuts efficiently, there are three main options:

- Use Spotlight _(Cmd + Space)_ to quickly look up a shortcut and use it.
- Add the shortcut to the desktop as a widget.
- Or manually use them from the Shortcuts app **_(not recommended.)_**

### Using Spotlight

By far the simplest way is to use Spotlight.

All we have to do is use the shortcut Command + Space, type in “Open Spotify,” and hit Return.

### Shortcuts as Desktop Widgets

To add shortcuts to the desktop, we have to right-click on the desktop and select “Edit Widgets.” In the menu that pops up, search for the Shortcuts app, and select the widget size you prefer.

Then drag and drop it straight onto the desktop.
