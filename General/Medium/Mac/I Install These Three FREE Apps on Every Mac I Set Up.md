Every so often in my line of work, fixing and building computers, I come across new apps and services that make my life easier and save me time. And, as someone who values _not_ having to shell out tons of money on software, I have a particular interest in finding free apps that are good enough to be paid software but are, amazingly, still free.

Anytime I set up one of my Macs, whether that’s to try out the macOS 26 beta or just resetting for a fresh start, I always find myself turning to these three apps.

There are others out there like them, no doubt, but these three are some of the best I’ve used, and I recommend them without reservation.

## Rectangle

In macOS Sequoia, Apple finally gave us the ability to snap application windows to the sides and corners of our screens. That’s something Windows has been able to do since Windows 7 released all the way back in 2009.

But Sequoia’s window snapping actually leaves much to be desired, sadly. Apple’s default keyboard shortcuts aren’t great and feel super cumbersome to me.

Apple’s way is to hit Function + Control + Option + Shift + an Arrow key. What is this? Twister? Yikes.

Prior to the release of Sequoia, I had been using an app called Magnet to bring this functionality to macOS, having depended on it for so long in Windows. But Magnet, as good as it is, is a paid app.

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/), on the other hand, is completely free and does the same thing.

Using Rectangle, I only have to hit Control + Option and then an Arrow key to snap app windows, or make use of one of the many other customizable keyboard shortcuts.

To use Rectangle, you’ll have to disable macOS’s built in snapping in the Dock settings.

Then, launch Rectangle and let it run at startup.

Once you do, you’ll be able to snap app windows just like before, but in a far more customizable way. Maybe one day Apple will make their built in solution easier to customize, but right now, a third party tool is the way to go for me.

## Keeping You Awake

I have often found it necessary to make sure my Mac stays on and awake for extended periods of time. Whether that’s to ensure that a download completes successfully or that sort of thing.

I learned my lesson the hard way a couple of years ago, in fact, when I was trying to upload a YouTube video right as I had to leave the house, only to find a couple of hours later that the video was no where to be found on the channel.

Why?

The Mac had gone to sleep. Rude.

Using [KeepingYouAwake](https://keepingyouawake.app/), I can tell my Mac to not sleep either indefinitely or for a set interval.

One thing I love about KeepingYouAwake is the fact that I can define my own activation durations if I want, instead of having to stick to any of those listed.

If I want to make sure my Mac doesn’t sleep for an oddly specific 1 hour and 37 minutes, I can do

If you don’t want to use a tool like KeepingYouAwake, the “caffeinate” Terminal command will do the same thing, but KeepingYouAwake is a much more user friendly way to go about it, in my opinion. Especially for those of us who don’t want to have to mess with the Terminal any more than we absolutely need to.

## AppCleaner

Windows and macOS share a very bad habit. When an application is uninstalled the official way, bits of that app are left behind. Now, usually they’re not very big. Sometimes a few megabytes. Sometimes even less. But it’s not great to leave things behind.

These bits of data are usually things like library entries and preference files, and various other databases that might not have been strictly part of the program but were created by the app and can be safely removed. And should be.

Working in IT, I’ve often had to reinstall programs to solve problems, and if little bits of those programs are left behind, a reinstall might not actually fix the issue. It may be that a problem was actually caused by one of those bits that didn’t get removed. So I want it all gone.

Sometimes, though perhaps less commonly, that data that gets left behind contains bits of personal information that you’d rather not leave on your system.

That’s where a tool like [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) comes in.

Instead of dragging an app to the trash like Apple tells you to do, you first open AppCleaner and drag that app into it. Then, AppCleaner finds all the little bits and pieces that would otherwise have been left over and offers to trash them for you along with the app itself.

Take this for example. If I were to just drag this Microsoft Defender app to the trash, it would delete the .app file from my Applications folder. That’s the bulk of the data, which is good at least. But it would be leaving behind at least a couple of files.

On the other hand, if I use AppCleaner, you can see that I’d be deleting both the Defender .app file and two of its supporting files that would still be stuck on my system.

No, that extra 63 KB of space isn’t much, but I still don’t want those things sticking around if I don’t need them.

There are other tools that will do this too, of course. But I like AppCleaner the best because it’s free and simple and doesn’t come with annoying “buy me” banners. Free? Does what it says it’ll do without being annoying? Win win.

## Always looking for free app alternatives

I’ve been working on and with computers for over three decades now. (I’m old.) In that time, I’ve paid way too much for far too many apps and services that I really shouldn’t have, looking back. There are just so many great free tools out there that do many of the same things.

Rectangle, Keeping You Awake, and AppCleaner are and are likely to remain three of my absolute favorite Mac apps of all time. They’re free, simple, and solid. A great combination.

And, as I love saying, free is a great price. Especially for software that works well.

Plus, if you’re already thinking ahead to macOS 26 Tahoe, I can confirm: they all work great on the upcoming macOS 26 release too. That’s a win win win… and win!
