**macOS Tahoe vs Sequoia**

Last year, When I first installed **macOS Sequoia**, I felt like Apple had finally turned the corner on serious productivity upgrades for Mac. There was a lot to like.

> Between **iPhone Mirroring** and **Apple Intelligence**, it was the most I’d seen Apple shake things up in a while.

**macOS Tahoe** (WWDC25, Apple)

But after watching the **WWDC 2025 keynote**, I realized something else, **macOS Sequoia was only the beginning**.

Meet the news **macOS Tahoe (aka macOS26)**.

Scheduled to roll out later this year (beta is out there already), macOS Tahoe is more than just a coat of paint.

> It is (actually) a thoughtful evolution that builds on Sequoia’s foundation — and if you’re running on an **M-series Mac**, you’re in for more special stuff.

Here are the **8 most exciting changes** in macOS Tahoe that genuinely got me pumped to update my MacBook.

## 1. Liquid Glass: A Whole New Look for macOS

**New liquid glass look (Apple)**

Let’s start with what hits you first — the design.

> Apple is giving the Mac (not limited to mac though) a fresh identity with what it calls **Liquid Glass**.

It’s a translucent, soft-edged interface where menus, dock, and panels blend seamlessly into your wallpaper and open apps. Think frosted glass with a (some) personality.

At first, I was (kinda skeptical).

I mean, we’ve all seen UI overhauls that look pretty but end up making things harder to use.

> But from what I’ve seen (myself) and heard from early testers, **Liquid Glass feels less like flash and more like function**.

It subtly reflects your environment and gives the desktop a (more) cohesive, modern aesthetic without sacrificing the clarity.

That said, I’m curious (and a bit cautious) about how it’ll perform on **Intel Macs**.

Translucency and animations can be resource-hungry (almost always), and since Apple’s clearly focusing on Apple Silicon, older machines may not get the smoothest ride.

## 2. Personalisation That Feels… Well, Personal

macOS Tahoe goes deeper into personalisation (customization) than any previous macOS.

**Customize Folder Icons with colors, emojis and more**

> Now, you can **customize folder icons with colors, emojis, or symbols**

> **It is a tiny change that makes a big difference if you’re the kind of person with 100 folders on your desktop (guilty).**

> Want to color-code by project? Done. Want to mark your “Invoices” folder with a ? simply go for it.

**Also, the Control Center gets a big usability boost.**

![Control Center](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1376/1*M0cyuBWr11Xe0sOIT_AaHw.jpeg)

**Control Center**

> You can now add **third-party widgets**, (even) including some from iPhone apps like Zoom or Spotify, directly into your Mac’s Control Center.

This makes quick access genuinely quicker and finally gives developers a reason to think about Control Center as a space, not just an afterthought.

## 3. Spotlight is No Longer Boring

![Spotlight Side view options](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1366/1*dw-PCwewup0X2DtK8B7SGA.jpeg)

**Spotlight Side view options**

I’ve been a Spotlight power user for years quick searches (well not so quick), launching apps, finding files. But within **macOS Tahoe**, Spotlight grows up.

> **Now, not only is it smarter with filters and suggestions, but it can also perform actions.**

**Action Mode Spotlight**

> Want to send a message? Type “SM” and Spotlight jumps straight into “Send Message” mode. Need to change a system setting? Just search for the command and apply it from Spotlight itself.(cool isn’t it)

Apple calls this “**Quick Key commands**,” and it is kind of like giving Spotlight a brain and a pair of hands.

If it works as smoothly as it looked during the demo (in personal experience it already is), **this could be the biggest upgrade for overall productivity in years**.

## 4. Apple Intelligence, Fully Activated

> Apple Intelligence debuted in Sequoia, but honestly speaking, it felt like half-baked (didn't impress much).

> **It was mostly limited to writing tools, image generation, and a Siri reboot that got… postponed.**

But in **Tahoe**,

> we finally see Apple Intelligence integrated into **how you work**.

**integrate Apple intelligence features with automation and shortcuts**

> **In Shortcuts, for example, you can create Intelligent Actions.**

In case you followed, one demo showed a student recording a lecture on their Mac, then having the AI **compare the audio transcription to their notes**, automatically filling in anything they missed.

That’s next-level assistive tech, and it’s the kind of AI I’m here for, but obviously more testing and real life experiences will give us a better idea.

Of course, all of this is **exclusive to Apple Silicon Macs** — which seems to be Apple’s way of nudging the rest of us off Intel.

## 5. iPhone + Mac = Even More Seamless

> macOS Sequoia started something amazing with **iPhone Mirroring**, but Tahoe (really) cranks it up.

Now, **Live Activities** from your iPhone appear on your Mac — say you’re waiting for a delivery or tracking a ride.

Get this: they’re fully **interactive, y**ou can check progress, respond, and interact **without picking up your iPhone**.

**Phone APP for Making or Receiving calls (Credit: Apple)**

> But the showstopper (to me)? The **Phone app** on Mac.

Yep. A full-fledged Phone app, that is powered by iPhone Mirroring.

> You can make and receive calls, browse your recents, check voicemails, plus use that **Hold Assist**, **Call Screening**, and **Live Translation**.

Apple Intelligence steps in again here:

- **Hold Assist** stays on hold for you.
- **Call Screening** talks to unknown callers, summarizes the purpose of the call.
- **Live Translation** gives real-time spoken translations during your call.

For people who work across time zones or speak multiple languages (like me), **this changes the game** (entirely)**.**

## 6. Messages Gets Smarter (and Prettier)

> **I never thought I’d get excited about the Messages app, but here we are.**

![Message Backgrounds](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1346/1*i-qO5lei405QkS2ggzS-OQ.jpeg)

**Message Backgrounds**

> With Tahoe, group chats can now have **custom background images,** small (I would say) but fun for sure.
> 
> But the real hero feature has to be the **message filtering**.

> Now, messages from unknown or suspicious contacts won’t clutter your main feed. (keep those bad gauys away)

It’s SMS peace of mind, especially if you deal with international numbers or get those frequent cold messages.

Plus, if you’re texting in multiple languages, you’ll love **Live Translations**.

> Type in English, your friend sees it in Spanish, and vice versa, all in real-time.

## 7. Automation Just Leveled Up

If you love automation (or want to love it), **Shortcuts** in macOS Tahoe is a dream.

> You can now set automations based on **time**, **events**, or **file actions**.

> **Want your external monitor setup to auto-trigger Focus Mode and launch Slack? You can set that.**
> 
> **Want a shortcut to run when you save a file to a certain folder? Done.**

This level of trigger-based automation is a first for macOS and makes Shortcuts way more powerful (especially for workflows and creators).

## 8. A Dedicated Games App? Finally!

**Game App**

Mac gaming still isn’t where it could be, but Apple is at least taking steps.

> With macOS Tahoe, there’s a new **Games app**, which acts like a hub for all your titles, plus offers in-game settings and the ability to **chat and invite friends**.

This feels like a nudge toward a more social, console-like experience on Mac. And while the catalog still needs (more) love, the infrastructure is improving and that’s a big deal if you’re into Apple Arcade or cloud gaming.

## So… Should You Update?

> If you’re running an **M-series Mac**, **macOS Tahoe is an absolute yes**.

Between AI-driven automation, real-time translations, and deeper iPhone integration, this update could genuinely transform how you use your Mac day-to-day.

> If you’re still on **Intel**, though? It is still a bit of a toss-up.

> **You’ll get the visual refresh and some UI upgrades, but no Apple Intelligence features, and possibly a hit to performance due to the Liquid Glass interface.**

You might want to hold off or start planning a move to Apple Silicon, especially since Intel support is rumored to end with the 2026 macOS release.

## Final Thoughts

macOS Tahoe isn’t just a cosmetic update, it’s **a pivot toward a smarter, more connected Mac experience**.

It makes your Mac feel more aware, more helpful, and more in sync with your iPhone. And while it’s clearly built for the future (read: M-series chips), that future is arriving fast.

For the first time in a while, **I’m not just updating macOS because I have to — I’m excited to**.

Let me know — what feature are _you_ most excited about in macOS Tahoe? Are you holding onto an Intel Mac, or is it finally time to upgrade?
