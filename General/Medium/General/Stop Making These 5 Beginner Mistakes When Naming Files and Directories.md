When starting out in technology, many beginners adopt bad habits related to naming files and directories, often because operating systems are designed to be user-friendly and allow practices that cause **real problems in professional IT work**. Establishing good naming habits from day one can save you significant frustration later.

Here are the top five mistakes beginners make, and the professional rules you should adopt instead.

### Rule 1: Say No to Spaces

While spaces in file and directory names might read nicer for regular users, they can cause serious problems, especially when working with command line or terminal commands.

==Why Spaces Break Things==

In command-line tools, a space often signifies moving on to a new part of the command, not that it is part of the file name. When using files with spaces, you are forced to add additional characters, called escape characters, or wrap the names in quotation marks or other symbols.

Spaces are also problematic in web development, as they are not valid in URLs and must be replaced by `%20` characters. At best, dealing with spaces is annoying, and at worst, they can break your code or commands.

Professional Separators

When dealing with names that contain multiple words, professionals typically use one of these four options instead of spaces:

1. **Underscores (_):** This is probably the most common choice (e.g., `my_project_file.py`).

2. **Hyphens (-):** These are very popular in web files, though some tools or programming languages may treat hyphens as subtraction operators (e.g., `my-project-file.py`).

3. **CamelCase:** The first character is lowercase, and then each additional word uses a capital letter (e.g., `myProjectFile.py`).

4. **PascalCase (or Proper Case/UpperCamelCase):** Each word starts with a capital letter, including the very first character (e.g., `MyProjectFile.py`).

### Rule 2: Avoid Risky Special Characters

Generally, the safest characters to use in file and directory names are letters **A to Z**, numbers **0 to 9**, and the **underscore**. While hyphens are usually safe, you should avoid special characters like dollar signs ($), exclamation points (!), and similar symbols.

Using these special characters is risky because depending on the software or tools you are using, they may cause problems. You should avoid special characters at all costs, except in rare cases where an application specifically requires them.

The Dot Character

The dot character (`.`) is a special case. It is used for file extensions and for denoting hidden files. You can, and must, use it for these specific purposes in file and directory names, but otherwise, you should avoid using it.

### Rule 3: Be Descriptively Concise

There is an art to naming things, and it is a surprisingly difficult aspect of being a technology professional. The goal is to select names that are **descriptive enough to be clear to others** but are not so long that they become a pain to type.

If you master this balance, your future self and your co-workers will greatly appreciate clear, descriptive names that explain the purpose of the file or directory.

### Rule 4: Assume Case Sensitivity (and When in Doubt, Go Lowercase)

As you move into professional technology environments, you quickly learn that letter casing often matters. For instance, capital `Hell` is usually not the same as lowercase `hello`. The exact behaviour depends on the tool and software you are using.

To save yourself significant pain and frustration, it is recommended to **always assume that letter casing matters**. If you are ever in doubt about which case to use, you should default to **lowercase characters**, as this is by far the most common convention, especially when working with servers.

### Rule 5: Use YYYYMMDD for Sorted Dates

Sometimes it is necessary to include a date in a file or directory name — such as for a log file or a daily data dump. When this is the case, the file name should be easily sorted by the date it references.

The Sorting Problem

If you use regional date formats (like `MM-DD-YYYY`), the files will not be sorted chronologically. This is because sorting works by comparing each character from left to right. For example, if you sort files where the month is listed first, the file starting with "12" will appear before the file starting with "2" (e.g., `12_report` will sort before `2_report`), meaning the files will be out of order.

The Professional Solution

To ensure proper sorting in ascending order, you should always use the **year month day (YYYYMMDD)** format for dates in file and directory names.

This format, which is the international standard, involves using leading zeros for the month and day. When files are named using `YYYYMMDD`, the names will be consistent, they will always be the same length, and each character can be compared properly, ensuring correct chronological sorting.

### Bonus Rule: Be Consistent

Once you establish a naming pattern within a project, you must **stick with it**.

In professional software development, teams often use style guides that provide specific instructions on how project files and directories should be named and organized. If you fail to follow these guides and remain inconsistent, you will likely annoy your peers.

By learning and applying these foundational rules from the beginning, you will have a much easier time getting started in learning IT skills, contributing to a better technical environment.
